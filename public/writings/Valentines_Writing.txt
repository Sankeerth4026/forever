Valentine week is not a new concept for me . It’s a “7-day celebration
of love”celebrated every year all over the world.

    But I’ve always wonder , “ is it really needed….?”

Well half of that thought came because i was single and jealous , other
half was because of what i believed about love.

To me, Love is a sacred thing , it happens slowly , calmly and
privately…handling all the chaos within ourself .

    Not on some scheduled calendar days , as if it’s some kind of performance.

     And I also used to wonder why exactly do couples who are already in love ,join to take part in this week ? Aren’t they are already in love , do they really need a week to express their love and not everyday?

This is what I belived and was not soo supportive of this Valentine
week.

But now…..

Here Iam celebrating this love-week and displaying all the love i can
show.

Being in love my perspective changed. Now I’ve realised…. It’s not
really about needing a week dedicated to promote loving your loved ones.

It’s about reminding yours loved one they are loved and they will be
loved forever .

Life gets busy. We get caught up in responsibilities, stress,deadlines,
personal battles etc..

We get Soo busy with our lives , we often times unknowingly forget to
pause everything for a sec and acknowledge that we are being loved ,
supported ,held on to at all times. We forget to reward ,appreciate and
reassure that we will Always be there and will love and be loved
forever. Soo valentine week is not performance It’s a reminder. to
remember you have someone to love , To realise you are being loved, To
remember to always appreciate love, To express your forever commitment,
To reassure those butterflies are not just confined to the lovey-dovely
stage of relationship.

It’s not about replacing everyday love. It’s about pausing everything in
our busy life and acknowledge that we are loved and celebrate your love
. Love doesn’t need a calendar , but the celebration does.

Soo….
