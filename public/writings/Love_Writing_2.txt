I am a type of person that strongly believes that you cannot completely
understand something until and unless you yourself experience it. That’s
the reason I don’t usually write about love , about longing someone ,
about missing etc.. All these complex emotions cannot be expressed just
with words even though one had felt them . So , what right did I have ,
to write something about them when I haven’t even experienced them . But
Nowwww , Ohhh my god , I don’t know if I have fully experienced the
depth of those emotions but what I am experiencing is already
overwhelming . Soo now within all my rights , I’ll write about these
emotions and feelings. All caused by none other than my most unexpected
miracle , my all time solace My love ❤️.

Our hearts often dream about having someone who hopefully becomes The
One . The One who can love us , bear us , understand us and mostly
importantly someone we can trust , giving our hearts forever and have
confidence they won’t break it !! . But then with time we either forget
we need one or realise the harsh truth that the world isn’t Soo kind ,
such a person rarely exists and even more rarely crosses path with us .

But rare doesn’t always mean impossible, the chances are less but never
zero . No matter how many times you fall in love , when this kind rare
love crosses your path you will fall in Love , in a way that makes every
other one seem as if it’s nothing. Soo embrace such a thing if it ever
crosses your path.

     Well that kind of love did cross my path , very unexpectedly , as if it was written like a part of a story which was waiting to be played in reality . I don’t usually believe in destiny but this one , the amount of coincidences it has and the way everything played out , I would  never in a million years expect or even imagine such a thing could actually happen. 

But against all the odds and obstacles it happened. So I’ll embrace and
protect it till the Veryy end.

Now you may tell , shut the fuck up Sankeerth we all have been there and
it’s just the start , so all those butterflies and all are common ,
don’t over do it .

Well you maybe right or you maybe wrong , either ways I am here to
express what I feel, what I think and what I know . And its heart
warmingly very beautiful.

     Soooo yes I love her sooo Soo much . “love”feels like a small word to describe what I feel , but then again, even I don’t really know how else to express. That is  the reason I add things like 

“very very much” “Sooo Soo much “ To make it better, just a simple”I
love you“ doesn’t feel like it covers the entire depth of love I have.
Now don’t think I have gone crazy in love. I just don’t know how to
describe it . Then again , If my love could really be expressed in
simple words , can I really call it my love ? Perhaps it would just be a
language. And it’s a good thing I cannot express it in words cause My
eyes which are already envying my heart for feeling something Soo deep
my eyes only dream of feeling , They would scream with such an intense
jealousy that would burn away the letters and words carrying the weight
and depth of my love , just to keep my love sacred , All for itself and
always within my heart. I don’t really know when my heart started to
love you . When did it Start to love you Soo much that it ached in your
absence , ached even more when Forever wasn’t soo certain . What I know
is somewhere between our “happy birthday Sankeerth” and “good night
nannuluuu “ between our “hello srija” and “bajjoo Bangaram” , we fell
for each other, veryyy deeply. Not suddenly but with each going day We
held pieces of eachother within our heart and in no time our hearts were
filled with pieces of eachother. They were Soo deep and Soo dear that we
couldn’t hold them in anymore and that’s when they overflowed in the
most beautiful form called , The Kiss. Yes our first kiss , where words
fell silent and our hearts spoke for themselves , telling everything
they ever what to say . Our first kiss, our cutest confession the moment
where it all began .

“In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible
summer.” —Albert Camus

“In your light, I learn how to love.” — Rumi

And before you ask, “ why do you love me Soooo much ??” Like Albert and
Rumi have mentioned, Even in my coldest corners, I found my warmth in
you.

Following the warmth , came the light and in that light I learnt what
love truly is

So whenever you ask “why” I love you Soo much It’s because my love
didn’t come from the world It was born from you , And That’s why it’s
Deeper than the oceans , Sweeter than honey, Stronger than eternity,
Gentler than spring, As pure as your heart, and will burn in my heart
Forever💖
